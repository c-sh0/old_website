Background
-----------

  Why did i write this ? Two reasons, First i am relatively new to C and
wanted to really code something worth it's grain of salt. The second reason
is a bit of a story so here goes.

    A little while ago an buffer overrun was discovered in the AOL Instant
Messenger followed by an exploit. https://www.securityfocus.com/bid/3769
It seemed that only windows platforms were vulnerable, as it turns out this
was not true. At least in my case one was able to perform a DoS attack regardless
of O/S. From what i understand it was a bug found within the protocol not
the client. About this time i was IM'd by an anonymous user by the name
of "r00tg04t". I was asked "What kind of aim client do you use ?" umm, yeah.
Anyway, After about some mins of mudd slinging, he's calling me names in all his/her
"L33t Speak" glory, He was able to DoS my AIM client. I thought to myself,
"Hahaha, gotta love it." whatever. Unfortunately i was at work and
i couldn't log back on AIM for like 2 hrs. I was like woah!. Well shit, i
guess this WAS a problem was in the AOL IM protocol. Oh well. So i decided i
wanted to see if i could track this dude down for a little bit of fun.
( yeah, yeah i get some free time now and then ) but how ?  Just off an
AIM name ? yeah right.

  So, just for kicks i stuck his name in google, i wasn't thinking i would get
any results back, but i figured what the hell, much to my amazement four links
show up with an e-mail address and a website. Laughing to myself i thought, not soo
bright are we. I checked his web site etc.. turns out this person likes to IRC
quite a bit. ( assuming of course it is the same person ) ok, cool. I began logging
into a bunch of IRC networks ( i don't IRC much at all ) triing to look for the
nickname "r00tg04t". Chances are, if he is using it on AIM and as an e-mail, I'm
sure this person will use it on IRC too, as it looks like their triing to make a
name for him/her self. well after about 30mins of checking IRC servers with like
100 to go, doing by hand was pointless, and chances are that "r00tg04t" wouldn't
be on the same server i was looking on at the time. So i thought AH-HA!, i wonder
if there is a application or script that will search all the IRC networks for a
particular nickname. ?? well i looked and asked around etc.. , and well surprisingly
there is not. ( at least none that i could find )

So i wrote my own. :)


Details
-----------

    It's kinda cheesy but what this program does is take a list of IRC servers and
corresponding port number separated with a colon ":", logs into each server and does
a dns, ison, whois, who, userhost and whowas ( see RFC1459 ) on a specified nick then saves the
results to a log file.
